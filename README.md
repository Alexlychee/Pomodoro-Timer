# Pomodoro-Timer
A pomodoro timer is a tool used in the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that involves working in 25-minute intervals with short breaks in between. 
The technique involves working for 25 minutes, then taking a 5-minute break. After four pomodoros, you take a longer 20-minute break.
